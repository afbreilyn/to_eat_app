# TO_EAT App
Credit to Doon Foster for the idea of this app: a dietary tracking app, where you can set your meal requirements per each day, and track each one as you complete it.

This app started from the [ionic tutorial app](http://ionicframework.com/tutorials/intro-tutorial/), but then was of course expanded and mutilated.

## features:
* many projects, each with their own todo lists
* ability to checkoff completed items

## things to do: 
* change projects to days, change todo to to-eat [18-12-14]
* proper (half decent) colours for li items [18-12-14]
* upon day creation, allow the input how much of which food groups [ ]
* counters in the 'day' which correspond to the checkboxes on each item [ ]
* space in which to write what you ate for each completed food item [ ]
